### Tetrils like game

*Simple pygame tetris game.*

Mostly to play around with some AI coding tools to see what they can do.  I'd guess I built this about twice as fast as I would have if I didn't have the assistants help me along.  And much less likely for me to abaondon the project, as I'm constantly making progress.


See a live demo of it (running via [Pybag](https://pygame-web.github.io/) and web assembly) at https://diederikjh.github.io/tlg/   Warning quite CPU intensive via web assembly
